# Operating Systems
This is a Repo for my CS3800 assignments. It contains my work for the various projects in the class.

## HW 1
This was a project to emulate some basic unix shell commands and mock a filesystem.

## HW 2
This was a project to implement various different schedulers into a framework and run various benchmarks

## Final Project
I built a rundimentary data structure to be stored in EEPROM on a TIVA C microcontroller using a EEPROM library that I worked on. I then implemented my HW 1 on top of it, with several modifications and with the commands and responsese being written over serial from my computer.
